## Manual Usage

Browse the repository and copy/paste any rule or skill directly into Agentforce Vibes or your preferred AI tool.

## Samples

The `samples/` folder contains synced sample apps. For example, `samples/webapp-template-app-react-sample-b2e-experimental/` is kept in sync with the npm package `@salesforce/webapp-template-app-react-sample-b2e-experimental` (nightly and on manual trigger via GitHub Actions). To run the same sync locally from the repo root:

```bash
npm install
npm run sync-react-b2e-sample
```

The GitHub Action runs these same commands and opens a PR only when the npm package version has changed. See [samples/README.md](samples/README.md) for details.


## 🛠️ Agent Skills

Agent Skills extend rules by bundling executable workflows, scripts, and reference materials into self-contained directories. Skills follow the open [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/) and are portable across many agent tools (Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code extensions, etc.).

### Directory Structure

Each skill is a folder containing:
- `SKILL.md` (required) - instructions + YAML frontmatter
- `scripts/` (optional) - executable Python/Bash/JS
- `references/` (optional) - additional documentation
- `assets/` (optional) - templates, schemas, lookup data
